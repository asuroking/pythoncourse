    "## Lesson 02 - Classes and Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to lesson 02 or 3 - You are nearly Python programmers, from which point we can jump into the data science and stats extensions to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, please download this notebook from : [here](/pythoncourse/assets/notebooks/r&d/lesson 02.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will cover object orientated programming, the way we represent everything in Python. Then we will finish with modules, how to import and write extensions to base Python. After this we are more or less done with base Python - you are ready to jump into the data science stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Orientated Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is a paradigm in programming. Python is OO, SQL is declarative, R is functional. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use OOP, we talk about Classes which are types of things and Objects, which are instances of classes, rather than being limited to built in data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "A helpful metaphor is to think of Pac-Man: The Ghosts all belong to the Ghost class, whereas each individual ghost (inky, blinky, pinky and clyde) are objects - instances of the ghost type, with their own behaviour. They can vary in their attributes (colour, speed, eatability, behaviour...). OOP allows us to take a more 'object orientated' approach - we can talk about the ghosts behaving in an easy to understand manner!\n",
    "\n",
    "By it's nature, OOP doesnt play nicely with tabular databases. Depending on our classes and implementations, SQL is not a good match - we can use noSQL or ODB, or use a more tabular friendly class.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, everything we have seen in Python is a Class (lists, strings, dicts, etc etc.). One of the great flexibilities in Python is an ability to make our own Classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall we have methods, which are specific to certain data types:"
