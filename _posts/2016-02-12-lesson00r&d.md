## Welcome to the Python course @ Precima

Hopefully, by now, everyone has read the syllabus, cheat sheets and course
outline on the
[main website](/pythoncourse).

Moreover, in this lesson, it's assumed you either attended the Applied Stream
intro to data
types lecture, and/or have read through [Lesson 00 - Applied
Section](/pythoncourse/2016/02/09/lesson00applied.html).

Today we will briefly go over the Anaconda environment and
then dive into Python statements and functions.

All lessons are made as iPython/Jupyter notebooks and will be available on this
site to
download. Grab todays lesson from [this
link!](/pythoncourse/assets/notebooks/r&d/lesson 00.ipynb).

### Python

Python is a programming language first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and
one of the most popular languages used in computing today. Python currently
ranks as the [5th most common language used on
github](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github).

Python is used as a scripting language, as well as in web development and to
create applications - some of the more popular websites and applications running
at least partially on Python include: Google, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram,
Reddit, Dropbox, Civilization IV, EVE Online and BitTorrent.

Python as a language is based on readability, flexibility, simplicity and
extensibility.

The extensibility of Python has caused it to be adopted, along with R, as one of
the premier data science programming languages.

Python has had many added on modules (or libraries) added to it, to allow data
science work which we will cover in this course.

In general compared to R, Python is faster, more programmer focussed and less
restrictive in licensing. The downside is new statistical methods tend to appear
in R before Python, although as the community grows, this has become less of a
problem.


### 2.7 vs 3

In 2008, Python version 3.0 was released. Due to the number and nature of
changes, Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 were not compatible. This has lead to a split
in the Python community, as many users were unwilling to fix existing code to 3
compatibility, and have since continued to develop Python 2.6 into 2.7, while
3.0 has been developed in parallel and currently stands at version 3.5.

In this course, we will use Python 3. This is due to the majority of users
having no legacy code to worry about, the better memory management, and the
availability of the data science stack in Python 3. If you are a die hard Python
2.7 user, feel free to continue using it, although you will need to fix the code
yourself.

In the level we will be coding at the changes are not too big, the largest
differences we will see are `print()` vs `print`, `xrange` vs `range` and other
generators. Python code found online will often be 2.7, but should be readable
by a 3 trained user.


### Anaconda, Spyder and iPython/Jupyter

We will use Anaconda, a distribution of Python by Continuum Analytics, put
together for use in data science.

Anaconda comes with most of the modules we need for data analysis. The Anaconda
launcher
updates and launches these apps, and includes:

(i) Spyder, which is the IDE we will use for the first few lessons. It allows
coding and
running scripts in an integrated environment.

(ii) The iPython/Jupyter notebook, which is a platform for developing interative
code-driven
documents (like these lessons!) in a browser. (iPython notebooks
are currently in the process of being rebranded into Jupyter
notebooks. The launcher and documentation - and we - will refer to them
interchangeably).

(ii)  The iPython-QT console, which is an advanced console allowing
inline graphing

These programs all run Python on the backend - the difference is in how you
interact with the environment, the possibilities that the environment provides,
and how
the input and output of your code is displayed and documented.


### Course Logistics


We will start the first part of the course by covering the data types and
structures,
before move on to loops and statements, then functions and classes. After that,
we will
introduce the standard data modules, Pandas and NumPy. Then, we will move onto
graphing,
optimization, machine learning and other fun topics.

Please note that the topics for the second half of the R&D class can be somewhat
flexible - they
can be adapted to suit the common interests of the class. So please let me know
if you are working
on something particular, or would like to look at a specific application or
problem, and we can
try and address these in the later classes.

Finally, note that we are tracking both group and individual progress, to make
sure this course is
giving value for your time. In this light, all attendees are required to
complete all quizzes and assessments
we will send out during the course. The time committment for this section is, at
minimum, 5 hours a week (though
a few more hours is strongly recommended).

One last thing: coding along with the lesson is encouraged!

### Outside Resources

A number of people have asked about text books or online resources for the
course. Most Python tutorials online will assume a knowledge at around the level
we will reach after a few lessons. I'm using [Python for Data
Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) for the Numpy and
Pandas section - it won't be necessary to purchase but is a good book (if a
little outdated). For the other lessons, links will be provided to the relevant
docs.



### Basic Data Types Review

| Type       | Example     | Mutable | Ordered | Duplicates | Subsetting |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| int        | 2           | NA      | NA      | NA         | NA         |
| float      | 2.5         | NA      | NA      | NA         | NA         |
| complex    | 2.5 + 0.6J  | NA      | NA      | NA         | NA         |
| boolean    | True        | NA      | NA      | NA         | NA         |
| string     | 'abcd'      | No      | Yes     | Yes        | x[1]       |
| list       | [1,2,3,'a'] | Yes     | Yes     | Yes        | x[1]       |
| tuple      | (1,2,3,'a') | No      | Yes     | Yes        | x[1]       |
| set        | {1,2,3,4}   | Yes     | No      | No         | No         |
| frozenset  | {1,2,3,4}   | No      | No      | No         | No         |
| dictionary | {1:1,2:2}   | Yes     | No      | No         | x['key']   |


### Numbers - Advanced


Internally, floats are stored as double in `C` - use sys.float_info for more
information about tolerances etc.

**In [1]:**

{% highlight python %}
import sys
sys.float_info
{% endhighlight %}




    sys.float_info(max=1.7976931348623157e+308, max_exp=1024, max_10_exp=308, min=2.2250738585072014e-308, min_exp=-1021, min_10_exp=-307, dig=15, mant_dig=53, epsilon=2.220446049250313e-16, radix=2, rounds=1)



Integers have unlimited precision

**In [2]:**

{% highlight python %}
z = 10**1000000 +1
z % 10
{% endhighlight %}




    1



Python 2.7 has another class, `large` for large numbers, Python 3 makes the
conversion implicilty and keeps type `int`:

**In [3]:**

{% highlight python %}
print(type(z))
del(z)
{% endhighlight %}

    <class 'int'>


### Booleans - Advanced

In addition to the standard boolean operators (<,>,==,!=,) mentioned in the
intro
class, there are five others: `in`,`is`,`not`, `any` and `all`. Any and all will
be introduced in the functional programming section.

**In [4]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = ['oranges','apples','bananas','bananas','kiwis']
'oranges' in l
{% endhighlight %}




    True



**In [5]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = 5
5 is l
##very similar to ==
{% endhighlight %}




    True



**In [6]:**

{% highlight python %}
#we are checking identity, not equality
l = ['oranges','apples','bananas']
k = ['oranges','apples','bananas']
print(l is k)
k = l
print(l is k)
{% endhighlight %}

    False
    True


**In [7]:**

{% highlight python %}
not True
{% endhighlight %}




    False



In Python (and most sensible languages), boolean comparisons are short circuit
operators - once one conditon is impossible we stop evaluating. This can get a
good speed up on code if you have one expensive comparison and one that is not -
Therefore, put the cheap calculation first!

**In [8]:**

{% highlight python %}
#del(l)
x = "bananas"
#l is not defined! This would give and error if it hits l
print(x == "bananas" or l == 4)
print(x == "bananas" and l == 4)
{% endhighlight %}

    True
    False


### Data Structures Review

**In [9]:**

{% highlight python %}
customer_1 = {'loyaltyids':(1234, 3456),
              'transactions':{1:['oranges','apples','bananas','pears','kiwis'],
                              2:['bread', 'milk','bananas','bananas']},
              'postalcodes':{'M5T1V1', 'M5S3B2'},
              'transactionspends':[100.46, 34.55],
              'usedcoupons':[True, False]}
{% endhighlight %}

**In [10]:**

{% highlight python %}
#subsetting here
{% endhighlight %}

## Python Statements

Python uses indentation, rather than braces, as its primary way of parsing loops
and statements. This was originally to force some degree of readability on code.

### If, Else, Elif

We can do if and else statements

**In [11]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = 4.99

if not True:
    print(x)
elif x < 5:
    print('on sale')
else:
    print('regular price')


#if True:
#print(x)
{% endhighlight %}

    on sale


and nest them as deep as we would like:

**In [12]:**

{% highlight python %}
pricehistory = [11]

if pricehistory[-1] >= 10 and len(pricehistory) == 1:
    if pricehistory[-1] >= 12:
        pricehistory.append(pricehistory[0] - 1)
        print('new price is ' + str(pricehistory[-1]))
    else:
        pricehistory.append(pricehistory[0] - 0.10 * pricehistory[-1])
        print('new price is ' + str(pricehistory[-1]))
elif len(pricehistory) > 1:
    pricehistory.append(min(pricehistory))
    print('new price is ' + str(pricehistory[-1]))
else:
    pricehistory.append(pricehistory[0]*0.9)
    print('new price is ' + str(pricehistory[-1]))

pricehistory
{% endhighlight %}

    new price is 9.9





    [11, 9.9]



### For loops

For loops work similarly in syntax to if and else. We can use them on any of the
major data structures we just introduced

**In [13]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = ['oranges','bread','bananas','milk']
fruits = ['oranges','apples','bananas','kiwis','strawberries', 'pears']

for item in l:
    if item in fruits:
        print("fruit")
    else:
        print("other")

print("\n")
s = ['oranges','bread','bananas','milk']

for item in s:
    if item in fruits:
        print("fruit")
    else:
        print("other")
{% endhighlight %}

    fruit
    other
    fruit
    other


    fruit
    other
    fruit
    other


On dictionaries, we have to do it a little differently

**In [14]:**

{% highlight python %}
d = {'produce':'banana', 'dairy':'milk', 'canned':'chickpeas'}

for k, v in d.items():
    print(k + ": " + v)
#unordered!

#similar for nested lists:

l = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]

for one, two in l:
    print(one * two)
    #no modifying!
    one = one * 2
l
{% endhighlight %}

    canned: chickpeas
    dairy: milk
    produce: banana
    2
    12
    30
    56





    [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]



### While loops

Similarly, we can use while loops, and run a loop until a condition is met

**In [15]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = 5

while x > 1:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
#also +=, *=, /=
{% endhighlight %}

    5
    4
    3
    2


### Break, Pass, Continue

We can skip, break or pass elements in our loops

**In [16]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,"oranges",6]

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print(num + " is not a number")
        break

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print(num + " is not a number")
        continue
        print("how did you get here?")

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print(num + " is not a number")
        pass
        print("how did you get here?")


{% endhighlight %}

    1
    2
    3
    4
    oranges is not a number
    1
    2
    3
    4
    oranges is not a number
    6
    1
    2
    3
    4
    oranges is not a number
    how did you get here?
    6


**In [17]:**

{% highlight python %}
#example
basket = [['apples', 2.50], ["oranges", 3.00], ['razors', 10.99], ['potatoes', 4.99], ['toothbrush', 2.99], ['pumpkin', 2.98],
          [9.99, "strawberries"]]
fruits = ['oranges','apples','bananas','kiwis','strawberries', 'pears']
veges = ['potatoes', 'parsnips', 'cabbage', 'pumpkins']

fruit = 0
veg = 0
other = []

while len(basket) > 0:
    x = basket.pop()
    if x[0] in fruits:
        fruit += x[1]
    elif x[0] in veges:
        veg += x[1]
    else:
        if isinstance(x[0], str) and isinstance(x[1], float):
            other.append(x)
        else:
            print(x, "not proper item")
            pass

#print(fruit, veg, other)

{% endhighlight %}

    [9.99, 'strawberries'] not proper item


### Range

We saw earlier, we cannot modify in place using a loop. We can instead use
`range` to generate indices and use these (NB range in Python 3 is similar to
xrange in Python 2.7, not `range`). Range objects are not instantly enumerated -
we dont have to hold them in memory.

**In [18]:**

{% highlight python %}
#similar to the subset from:to:by
range(0,10,2)
type(range(0,10))
{% endhighlight %}




    range



**In [19]:**

{% highlight python %}
#not instantly enumerated! this would fill the memory of nearly all computers
range(100000000000000000)
{% endhighlight %}




    range(0, 100000000000000000)



**In [20]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
range(len(l))
{% endhighlight %}




    range(0, 6)



**In [21]:**

{% highlight python %}
for i in range(len(l)):
    l[i] = l[i]*2
l
{% endhighlight %}




    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]



**In [22]:**

{% highlight python %}
#also useful for generating simple lists:
list(range(10))
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]



We also have the built in function, `enumerate` which can give us a tuple of the
index and value at each position in a sequence:

**In [23]:**

{% highlight python %}
cheese = ['gouda','cheddar','edam','brie']
print(list(enumerate(cheese)))
for i,j in enumerate(cheese):
    print('item {i} is {j}'.format(i = i, j = j))
{% endhighlight %}

    [(0, 'gouda'), (1, 'cheddar'), (2, 'edam'), (3, 'brie')]
    item 0 is gouda
    item 1 is cheddar
    item 2 is edam
    item 3 is brie


### Zip

zip is a built in python function, that 'zips' sequences into tuples:

**In [24]:**

{% highlight python %}
item = ['oranges','apples','bananas','kiwis','strawberries']
cost = [7,8,9,10,11]
units = [12,13,14,15,16]
list(zip(item,cost,units))
{% endhighlight %}




    [('oranges', 7, 12),
     ('apples', 8, 13),
     ('bananas', 9, 14),
     ('kiwis', 10, 15),
     ('strawberries', 11, 16)]



### Comprehensions

Comprehensions are are syntactic sugar for for loops. We can make lists (or set
or dicts) using this method. Tuples might seem like they should also have a
method, but this is reserved for generators, which will discuss later on in the
course.


**In [25]:**

{% highlight python %}
#for loop
l = []
for i in range(10):
    l.append(i * 5)
l
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]



**In [26]:**

{% highlight python %}
#comprehension
[i * 5 for i in range(10)]
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]



**In [27]:**

{% highlight python %}
#dict comprehension
{i * 10 : j * 2  for i, j in {1: 'a', 2: 'b'}.items()}
{% endhighlight %}




    {10: 'aa', 20: 'bb'}



**In [28]:**

{% highlight python %}
celsius = [0,100,25,37]
[((9/5)*temp + 32) for temp in celsius]
{% endhighlight %}




    [32.0, 212.0, 77.0, 98.60000000000001]



**In [29]:**

{% highlight python %}
#nested
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[el * 2 for el in row] for row in matrix]
{% endhighlight %}




    [[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12], [14, 16, 18]]



### Ternary expressions

Ternary expressions are a fancy way of doing `if` `else` and are very pythonic:

**In [30]:**

{% highlight python %}
a = 12
a if a > 11 else b
{% endhighlight %}




    12



**In [31]:**

{% highlight python %}
a = 10
b = "no"
a if a > 11 else b
{% endhighlight %}




    'no'



we can chain this with our comprehensions

**In [32]:**

{% highlight python %}
[a if a else 2 for a in [0,1,0,3]]
{% endhighlight %}




    [2, 1, 2, 3]



or our nested comprehensions

**In [33]:**

{% highlight python %}
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[el * 2 if el % 2 == 0 else el for el in row] for row in matrix]
{% endhighlight %}




    [[1, 4, 3], [8, 5, 12], [7, 16, 9]]



As these comprehensions are not faster than a for loop, it is worth using for
loops once you can't follow clearly what the comprehension is doing (I would
almost never use a nested comprehension)!

**In [34]:**

{% highlight python %}
cheese = {'gouda': 9.99, 'cheddar': 8.99, 'edam': 6.99, 'brie': 10.99}
cheese.update({i + ' sale' : round(j * 0.9, 2) for i, j in cheese.items()})
{% endhighlight %}

### Intro to Functions

Functions are one of the key parts of any programming language. Today we will
touch on basic syntax and definition, and move into a more thorough exploration
in the next class.

**In [35]:**

{% highlight python %}
def celcius_to_fahr(temp):
    return (9/5)*temp + 32

celcius_to_fahr(100)
{% endhighlight %}




    212.0



**In [36]:**

{% highlight python %}
def kelvin_to_celcius(temp):
    return temp - 273

kelvin_to_celcius(100)
{% endhighlight %}




    -173



**In [37]:**

{% highlight python %}
def kelvin_to_fahr(temp):
    return celcius_to_fahr(kelvin_to_celcius(temp))

kelvin_to_fahr(273)
{% endhighlight %}




    32.0



**In [38]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfirstfun(arg1, arg2):
    '''Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
    It can be as long as you'd like.
    This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them
    '''
    return(arg1 + arg2)

help(myfirstfun)
{% endhighlight %}

    Help on function myfirstfun in module __main__:

    myfirstfun(arg1, arg2)
        Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
        It can be as long as you'd like.
        This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them



**In [39]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun(1, 2)
{% endhighlight %}




    3



**In [40]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun("h", "i")
{% endhighlight %}




    'hi'



We might not want our function to work on strings! We can Raise an error is the
arguments are not numeric:

**In [41]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfirstfun(arg1, arg2):
    '''Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
    It can be as long as you'd like.
    This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them
    '''
    for i in arg1, arg2:
        assert type(i) == int or type(i) == float, "This function requires numerics"
    return(arg1 + arg2)

myfirstfun(1,2)
{% endhighlight %}




    3



**In [42]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun("h", "i")
{% endhighlight %}


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-42-b9e7ba21c90e> in <module>()
    ----> 1 myfirstfun("h", "i")


    <ipython-input-41-f4e6512fed1f> in myfirstfun(arg1, arg2)
          5     '''
          6     for i in arg1, arg2:
    ----> 7         assert type(i) == int or type(i) == float, "This function requires numerics"
          8     return(arg1 + arg2)
          9


    AssertionError: This function requires numerics


### Passing Multiple Arguments and Default Values

Some functions will need to take an unknown number of arguments, or a default
value:

**In [43]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfirstfun(arg1, arg2 = 2, *moreargs):
    '''
    This function takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them
    any extra arguments are printed to the screen
    '''
    for i in arg1, arg2:
        assert type(i) == int or type(i) == float
    print("here are the extra arguments {x}".format(x = list(moreargs)))
    return(arg1 + arg2)

myfirstfun(1,2,3,4,5,6)
{% endhighlight %}

    here are the extra arguments [3, 4, 5, 6]





    3



**In [44]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun(10)
{% endhighlight %}

    here are the extra arguments []





    12



### Named Arguments

Python supports named arguments, unlike most languages, but similar to R:

**In [45]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(a, b):
    return(a ** 3 + b)
myfunction(b = 3, a = 2)
#by position, expect 29

We go by name, then order

**In [46]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(item, number = 1, cost = 3, weight = 1):
    for i in item,number,cost,weight:
        print(i)
myfunction("bananas", cost = 5)
print("\n")
myfunction("oranges", 3)
{% endhighlight %}

    bananas
    1
    5
    1


    oranges
    3
    3
    1


We can combine named and unnamed values. Any positional arguments are passed as
a tuple, any named arguments are passed as a dictionary. We add a \* to
positional, and \*\* to keyword arguments.

Named arguments must go last:

**In [47]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(*positional, **keywords):
    print("Positional:", positional)
    print("Keywords:", keywords)

myfunction('one', 'two', 'three')
myfunction('one', a = 'two', b = 'three')
{% endhighlight %}

    Positional: ('one', 'two', 'three')
    Keywords: {}
    Positional: ('one',)
    Keywords: {'b': 'three', 'a': 'two'}


**In [48]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfunction(a = 'one', b = 'two', 'three')
{% endhighlight %}


      File "<ipython-input-48-80cc4c5ccb1f>", line 1
        myfunction(a = 'one', b = 'two', 'three')
                                        ^
    SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument



### Warning

For default values, we evaluate them at function definition - this saves time
but can lead to error when using mutable defaults

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(a = 1, b = 2^45):
    return(a + b)
print(myfunction())
print(myfunction(2,4))
print(b)
{% endhighlight %}

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(item = "apples", basket = []):
    basket.append(item)
    return(basket)

print(myfunction("apples"))
print(myfunction("bananas"))
#extremely weird behaviour for anyone coming from R!
{% endhighlight %}

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(item = 1, basket = None):
    if basket is None:
        basket = []
    basket.append(item)
    return(basket)
print(myfunction("apples"))
print(myfunction("bananas"))
{% endhighlight %}

### Closures

We can do almost anything we'd like inside a function, including defining other
functions:

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
def internaldef(a,b):
    def helper(c):
        return(c ** 5)
    return(helper(a) + helper(b))
internaldef(2,2)
{% endhighlight %}

Internal functions have access to the enclosing variables:

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
def internaldef(a,b):
    def helper(c):
        return(c ** b)
    return(helper(a) + helper(b))
internaldef(2,2)
{% endhighlight %}

And we can even return them (a function generating function is technically a
'closure'):

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
def makepow(a):
    def pown(num):
        return(num ** a)
    return(pown)
pow4 = makepow(4)
pow4(3)
{% endhighlight %}

### Lambda Functions and map

Lambda functions are functions which are defined and used in the same place -
they are 'anonymous' (see Rs version `lapply(x, function(z) z^2`)). They are
generally used inside another statement, where defining a function is not worth
the time.

We can also use the lamdba to define a function:

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfun = lambda x,y: x+y
myfun(1,2)
{% endhighlight %}

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
[myfun(x,y) for x,y in l]
{% endhighlight %}

`map` takes two arguments - a function (often a lambda function) and a sequence
(or sequences) to iterate over

**In [49]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
x = map(lambda x: x if x % 2 == 1 else x **2, l)
list(x)
{% endhighlight %}




    [1, 4, 3, 16, 5, 36]



**In [50]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = range(6)
k = range(6,12)
x = map(lambda x,y : x*y, l,k)
list(x)
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 7, 16, 27, 40, 55]



**In [51]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = map(lambda x, y: x if x%2 == 1 else y, l,k)
list(x)
{% endhighlight %}




    [6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5]



### Functional Programming : Filter, Any, All and Reduce

In addition to map, several other built in functions use lambda functions, or
take functions as arguments. Python purists might say to use the more explicit
loops, but functional programming is highly optimized.

### Filter

Filter is used to remove certain items from a sequence:

**In [52]:**

{% highlight python %}
basket = ['oranges','bread','bananas','milk']
fruits = ['oranges','apples','bananas','kiwis','strawberries', 'pears']
out = []
for item in basket:
    if item in fruits:
        out.append(item)
out
{% endhighlight %}




    ['oranges', 'bananas']



**In [53]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = filter(lambda x: x in fruits, basket)
list(x)
{% endhighlight %}




    ['oranges', 'bananas']



### Any and all

any and all are functions which check if every (or any) member or an iterable
are True:

**In [54]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [True, True, True]
print(all(l))
print(any(l))
{% endhighlight %}

    True
    True


We can use them similar to generators however:

**In [55]:**

{% highlight python %}
basket = ['oranges','bread','bananas','milk']
fruits = ['oranges','apples','bananas','kiwis','strawberries', 'pears']
print(any(item in fruits for item in basket))
print(all(item in fruits for item in basket))
{% endhighlight %}

    True
    False


**In [56]:**

{% highlight python %}
#empty lists have differing behaviour
l = []
print(any(l))
print(all(l))
{% endhighlight %}

    False
    True


### Reduce

Reduce was removed from base Python in version 3.0, but remains a source of
controversy, as it is a key function in higher level programming languages. The
official advice is to use a loop:

**In [57]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [2,3,4,5]
result = l[0]

for i in l[1:]:
    result = result**i
result
{% endhighlight %}




    1152921504606846976



We can import reduce from functools:

**In [58]:**

{% highlight python %}
from functools import reduce

l = [2,3,4,5]
reduce(lambda x, y: x ** y, l)
{% endhighlight %}




    1152921504606846976



That's it for today. Next week we will move onto advanced functions - scope,
recursion, decorators and hashing, as well as classes - how to define our own
data types and methods

## Motivation

How much can we actually learn and predict from Data Science using Python?

Recently, a match fixing ring in professional tennis was alleged by a joint
investigation between [BBC news](http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35319202) and
[Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket#.eplO3d4px),
resulting in a large amount of news coverage.

The data analysis carried out was done in Python, and released online as an
[iPython Notebook](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-
analysis/blob/master/notebooks/tennis-analysis.ipynb). This story, and its
continued fall out, was [front page news on the
Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/09/revealed-tennis-umpires-
secretly-banned-gambling-scam) last week (9-Feb-2016).

Have a read through the notebook, take note of the functions and methods used on
the data, and see if you believe the analysis.

## Exercises

First, run through the exercises from the applied streams lesson 1 if you have
not already done this.

* `in` can generalise to strings - `'im' in 'Precima'` will give True. Can you
think of a way to test if letters are in a string in any order? For now, ignore
any duplicates. 'imP' should resolve to True if compared to 'Precima'

* Rewrite your answer above using `all`, a for loop, a lambda function with map
and a comprehension. Which one feels the most natural to you?

* We have a nested dictionary of transactions - dict =
{'user1':{1:345,2:546.5,3:987}, 'user2':{1:546, 2:744.4, 3:454.4}}. Use a nested
list comprehension to get out a list of the values:[[345, 546.5, 987], [546,
744.4, 454.4]]. Can you think of a better way? Can you zip this list to [(345,
546), (546.5, 744.4), (987, 454.4)]?

* Why does range not enumerate to a list all at once? How can you force it to?

* How does zip behave on lists of different sizes? (l = [1,2,3], k =
[1,2,3,4,5]). Make a function or loop that works until the longest list ends.
What should the output look like?

* Make your own function for converting fahrenheit to celsius

* Update the above function to have a docstring, explaining what it does

* Update the function to only take int or floats - use an assertion

* Write a function to take an arbitrary number of unnamed arguments, and return
their sum. Make sure you have a docstring, and test for numerics.

* Modify the above argument to use `reduce`

* Write a function that takes an arbitrary number of named arguments, and
returns the key of those that had even numbers as their input. myfunc(a = 1, b =
2, c = 3, d = 4) should return ['b', 'd']

* Write a function to make a function to check if an item is in a list: myfruits
= myfunc(fruits), myfruits(["apple", 'banana', 'potato', 'cauliflower']) should
return [True, True, False, False]. fruits =
['oranges','apples','bananas','kiwis','strawberries', 'pears'].

* Update the above function, to generate a function which will return a single
True or False if any members of the list are present.

* Update the above function to return as above, but with a return of True when
called on an empty list: myfruits([]) will give True
