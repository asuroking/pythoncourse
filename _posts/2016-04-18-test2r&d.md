## Welcome to Test 2

Please read these instructions carefully!

To access the test, you must first fill out the end of course survey, available
[online here](http://goo.gl/forms/nN59IpkR36). The responses will be anonymous.

The survey contains a link to the test notebooks - please click on the link and
the relevant notebook and either the data or machine learning test.

Github will render the notebooks online if you'd like to read them, download them from the download links.

Please open the test using the Jupyter notebook.

The save icon is in the upper left corner - please save your work regularly, and
once complete, email the entire notebook to Jeremy at jeremycgray+pythoncourse@gmail.com
