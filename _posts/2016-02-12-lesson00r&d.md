## Welcome to the Python course @ Precima

Hopefully everyone has read the syllabus, cheat sheets and course outline on the
website.

They are available at www.jeremy.kiwi.nz/pythoncourse.

All lessons are made as iPython notebooks and will be available on this site to
download. Grab todays lesson from [this
link!](/pythoncourse/assets/notebooks/r&d/lesson 00.ipynb).

In this lesson I'll assume you either attended the Applied Stream intro to data
types lecture, or have read it through [from the
website](http://jeremy.kiwi.nz/pythoncourse/2016/02/09/lesson00applied.html).

Today we will briefly go over course logistics and the Anaconda environment and
then dive into Python statements and functions.

### Python

Python is a programming language first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and
one of the most popular languages used in computing today. Python currently
ranks as the [5th most common language used on
github](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github).

Python is used as a scripting language, as well as in web development and to
create applications - some of the more popular websites and applications running
at least partially on Python include: Google, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram,
Reddit, Dropbox, Civilization IV, EVE Online and BitTorrent.

Python as a language is based on readability, flexibility, simplicity and
extensibility.

The extensibility of Python has caused it to be adopted, along with R, as one of
the premier data science programming languages.

Python has had many added on modules (or libraries) added to it, to allow data
science work which we will cover in this course.

In general compared to R, Python is faster, more programmer focussed and less
restrictive in licensing. The downside is new statistical methods tend to appear
in R before Python, although as the community grows, this has become less of a
problem.

### Anaconda, iPython and Spyder

We will use Anaconda, a distribution of Python by Continuum Analytics, put
together for use in data science.

Anaconda comes with most of the modules we need for data analysis, as well as
Jupyter notebooks, and the IDE we will use for the first couple of lessons,
Spyder.

We have installed the launcher, which allows updating and launching these apps,
the Spyder IDE which allows coding and running scripts in an integrated
environment, the iPython-QT console, which is an advanced console allowing
inline graphing, and the iPython notebook, which allows development in
interactive notebooks in the browser. These programs all run Python code - the
difference is in how you interact with the environment.

iPython notebooks are currently in the process of being rebranded into Jupyter
notebooks - the launcher and documentation will refer to them interchangeably.

Coding along with the lesson is encouraged!



### 2.7 vs 3

In 2008, Python version 3.0 was released. Due to the number and nature of
changes, Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 were not compatible. This has lead to a split
in the Python community, as many users were unwilling to fix existing code to 3
compatibility, and have since continued to develop Python 2.6 into 2.7, while
3.0 has been developed in parallel and currently stands at version 3.5.

In this course, we will use Python 3. This is due to the majority of users
having no legacy code to worry about, the better memory management, and the
availability of the data science stack in Python 3. If you are a die hard Python
2.7 user, feel free to continue using it, although you will need to fix the code
yourself.

In the level we will be coding at the changes are not too big, the largest
differences we will see are `print()` vs `print`, `xrange` vs `range` and other
generators. Python code found online will often be 2.7, but should be readable
by a 3 trained user.


### Course Logistics

We will start by covering the basic data types and structures, move on to loops
and statements, then functions and classes. In lessons 4 and 5 we will introduce
the standard data  modules, Pandas and NumPy, then move on into graphing, code
optimization and machine learning. Please let me know if you have any particular
applications or problems, and we will try and address the common ones in class.

We are tracking progress, to make sure this course is giving value for your time
- Please make sure you answer the quizzes and assessments we will send out later
in the course.

### Outside Resources

A number of people have asked about text books or online resources for the
course. Most Python tutorials online will assume a knowledge at around the level
we will reach at the end of lesson 3. I'm using [Python for Data
Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) for the numpy and
pandas section - It won't be necessary to purchase but is a good book if a
little outdated. For the other lessons, links will be provided to the relevant
docs.



## Basic Data Types Review

| Type       | Example     | Mutable | Ordered | Duplicates | Subsetting |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| int        | 2           | NA      | NA      | NA         | NA         |
| float      | 2.5         | NA      | NA      | NA         | NA         |
| complex    | 2.5 + 0.6J  | NA      | NA      | NA         | NA         |
| boolean    | True        | NA      | NA      | NA         | NA         |
| string     | 'abcd'      | No      | Yes     | Yes        | x[1]       |
| list       | [1,2,3,'a'] | Yes     | Yes     | Yes        | x[1]       |
| tuple      | (1,2,3,'a') | No      | Yes     | Yes        | x[1]       |
| set        | {1,2,3,4}   | Yes     | No      | No         | No         |
| frozenset  | {1,2,3,4}   | No      | No      | No         | No         |
| dictionary | {1:1,2:2}   | Yes     | No      | No         | x['key']   |


### Numbers - Advanced


Internally, floats are stored as double in `C` - use sys.float_info for more
information about tolerances etc.

**In [86]:**

{% highlight python %}
import sys
sys.float_info
{% endhighlight %}




    sys.float_info(max=1.7976931348623157e+308, max_exp=1024, max_10_exp=308, min=2.2250738585072014e-308, min_exp=-1021, min_10_exp=-307, dig=15, mant_dig=53, epsilon=2.220446049250313e-16, radix=2, rounds=1)



Integers have unlimited precision

**In [6]:**

{% highlight python %}
z = 10**1000000 +1
z % 10
{% endhighlight %}




    1



Python 2.7 has another class, `large` for large numbers, Python 3 makes the
conversion implicilty and keeps type `int`:

**In [7]:**

{% highlight python %}
print(type(z))
del(z)
{% endhighlight %}

    <class 'int'>


### Booleans - Advanced

We can use three additional boolean comparisons not mentioned in the previous
class: `in` and `is` and `not`:

**In [46]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,5]
3 in l
{% endhighlight %}




    True



**In [49]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = 5
5 is l
##very similar to ==
{% endhighlight %}




    True



**In [50]:**

{% highlight python %}
#we are checking identity, not equality
l = [1,2,3]
k = [1,2,3]
print(l is k)
k = l
print(l is k)
{% endhighlight %}

    False
    True


**In [13]:**

{% highlight python %}
not True
{% endhighlight %}




    False



In Python (and most sensible languages), boolean comparisons are short circuit
operators - once one conditon is impossible we stop evaluating. This can get a
good speed up on code if you have one expensive comparison and one that is not -
put the cheap calculation first

**In [61]:**

{% highlight python %}
#del(l)
x = 5
#l is not defined! This would give and error if it hits l
print(x == 5 or l == 4)
print(x == 3 and l == 4)
{% endhighlight %}

    True
    False


### Data Structures Review

**In [63]:**

{% highlight python %}
mystruct = [1, True, ('abcd', {2.5, 3J}), [3,4,['hello'],{'k1':[1,2,3], 'k2':{'k1':[3,5,6]}}]]
{% endhighlight %}

**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
#subsetting here
{% endhighlight %}

## Python Statements

Python uses indentation, rather than braces, as its primary way of parsing loops
and statements. This was originally to force some degree of readability on code.

### If, Else, Elif

We can do if and else statements

**In [44]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = 5

if not True:
    print(x)
elif x == 5:
    print(x+1)
else:
    print("no")


#if True:
#print(x)
{% endhighlight %}

    6


and nest them as deep as we would like:

**In [45]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = [10]

if x[0] >= 10 and len(x) == 1:
    if x[0] % 2 == 0:
        if abs(x[0]) > 50:
            print(x)
        else:
            print(x[0] + 1)
            if x[0] // 3 == 3:
                x.append(1)
    elif x[0] * 3 > 25:
        x.append("hi")
    else:
        x.append("bye")
else:
    print(x[0]+5)
x
{% endhighlight %}

    11





    [10, 1]



### For loops

For loops work similarly in syntax to if and else. We can use them on any of the
major data structures we just introduced

**In [46]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

for num in l:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("even")
    else:
        print("odd")

print("\n")
s = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

for num in s:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("even")
    else:
        print("odd")
{% endhighlight %}

    odd
    even
    odd
    even
    odd
    even
    odd
    even


    odd
    even
    odd
    even
    odd
    even
    odd
    even


On dictionaries, we have to do it a little differently

**In [47]:**

{% highlight python %}
d = {'k1':'v1', 'k2':'v2', 'k3':'v3'}

for k, v in d.items():
    print(k + v)

#similar for nested lists:

l = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]

for one, two in l:
    print(one * two)
    #no modifying!
    one = one * 2
l
{% endhighlight %}

    k3v3
    k2v2
    k1v1
    2
    12
    30
    56





    [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]



### While loops

Similarly, we can use while loops, and run a loop until a condition is met

**In [90]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = 5

while x > 1:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
#also +=, *=, /=
{% endhighlight %}

    5
    4
    3
    2


### Break, Pass, Continue

We can skip, break or pass elements in our loops

**In [49]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,"hi",6]

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print("it's not a number")
        break

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print("it's not a number")
        continue
        print("how did you get here?")

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print("it's not a number")
        pass
        print("how did you get here?")


{% endhighlight %}

    1
    2
    3
    4
    it's not a number
    1
    2
    3
    4
    it's not a number
    6
    1
    2
    3
    4
    it's not a number
    how did you get here?
    6


continue and break only go up to the nearest closest loop - if we are nested we
don't go right to the end of the statement:

**In [84]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,"hi",6]

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        if num % 2 == 1:
            continue
            print(num)
        else:
            print(num)
    else:
        continue
{% endhighlight %}

    2
    4
    6


### Range

We saw earlier, we cannot modify in place using a loop. We can instead use
`range` to generate indices and use these (NB range in Python 3 is similar to
xrange in Python 2.7, not `range`). Range objects are not instantly ennumerated
- we dont have to hold them in memory.

**In [85]:**

{% highlight python %}
#similar to the subset from:to:by
range(0,10,2)
type(range(0,10))
{% endhighlight %}




    range



**In [None]:**

{% highlight python %}
#not instantly ennumerated! this would fill the memory of nearly all computers
range(100000000000000000)
{% endhighlight %}

**In [52]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
range(len(l))
{% endhighlight %}




    range(0, 6)



**In [53]:**

{% highlight python %}
for i in range(len(l)):
    l[i] = l[i]*2
l
{% endhighlight %}




    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]



**In [54]:**

{% highlight python %}
#also useful for generating simple lists:
list(range(10))
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]



### Comprehensions

Comprehensions are are syntactic sugar for for loops. We can make lists (or set
or dicts) using this method. Tuples might seem like they should also have a
method, but this is reserved for generators, which will discuss later on in the
course.


**In [55]:**

{% highlight python %}
#for loop
l = []
for i in range(10):
    l.append(i * 5)
l
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]



**In [56]:**

{% highlight python %}
#comprehension
[i * 5 for i in range(10)]
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]



**In [57]:**

{% highlight python %}
#dict comprehension
{i * 10 : j * 2  for i, j in {1: 'a', 2: 'b'}.items()}
{% endhighlight %}




    {10: 'aa', 20: 'bb'}



**In [58]:**

{% highlight python %}
celsius = [0,100,25,37]
[((9/5)*temp + 32) for temp in celsius]
{% endhighlight %}




    [32.0, 212.0, 77.0, 98.60000000000001]



**In [59]:**

{% highlight python %}
#nested
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[el * 2 for el in row] for row in matrix]
{% endhighlight %}




    [[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12], [14, 16, 18]]



### Ternary expressions

Ternary expressions are a fancy way of doing `if` `else` and is very pythonic:

**In [60]:**

{% highlight python %}
a = 12
a if a > 11 else b
{% endhighlight %}




    12



**In [61]:**

{% highlight python %}
a = 10
b = "no"
a if a > 11 else b
{% endhighlight %}




    'no'



we can chain this with our comprehensions

**In [62]:**

{% highlight python %}
[a if a else 2 for a in [0,1,0,3]]
{% endhighlight %}




    [2, 1, 2, 3]



or our nested comprehensions

**In [63]:**

{% highlight python %}
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[el * 2 if el % 2 == 0 else el for el in row] for row in matrix]
{% endhighlight %}




    [[1, 4, 3], [8, 5, 12], [7, 16, 9]]



As these comprehensions are not faster than a for loop, it is worth using for
loops once you can't follow clearly what the comprehension is doing (I would
almost never use a nested comprehension)!

## Intro to Functions

Functions are one of the key parts of any programming language. Today we will
touch on basic syntax and definition, and move into a more thorough exploration
in the next class.

**In [64]:**

{% highlight python %}
def celcius_to_fahr(temp):
    return (9/5)*temp + 32

celcius_to_fahr(100)
{% endhighlight %}




    212.0



**In [65]:**

{% highlight python %}
def kelvin_to_celcius(temp):
    return temp - 273

kelvin_to_celcius(100)
{% endhighlight %}




    -173



**In [66]:**

{% highlight python %}
def kelvin_to_fahr(temp):
    return celcius_to_fahr(kelvin_to_celcius(temp))

kelvin_to_fahr(273)
{% endhighlight %}




    32.0



**In [67]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfirstfun(arg1, arg2):
    '''Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
    It can be as long as you'd like.
    This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them
    '''
    return(arg1 + arg2)

help(myfirstfun)
{% endhighlight %}

    Help on function myfirstfun in module __main__:

    myfirstfun(arg1, arg2)
        Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
        It can be as long as you'd like.
        This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them



**In [68]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun(1, 2)
{% endhighlight %}




    3



**In [69]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun("h", "i")
{% endhighlight %}




    'hi'



We might not want our function to work on strings! We can Raise an error is the
arguments are not numeric:

**In [92]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfirstfun(arg1, arg2):
    '''Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
    It can be as long as you'd like.
    This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them
    '''
    for i in arg1, arg2:
        assert type(i) == int or type(i) == float, "This function requires numerics"
    return(arg1 + arg2)

myfirstfun(1,2)
{% endhighlight %}




    3



**In [93]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun("h", "i")
{% endhighlight %}


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-93-b9e7ba21c90e> in <module>()
    ----> 1 myfirstfun("h", "i")


    <ipython-input-92-f4e6512fed1f> in myfirstfun(arg1, arg2)
          5     '''
          6     for i in arg1, arg2:
    ----> 7         assert type(i) == int or type(i) == float, "This function requires numerics"
          8     return(arg1 + arg2)
          9


    AssertionError: This function requires numerics


### Passing Multiple Arguments and Default Values

Some functions will need to take an unknown number of arguments, or a default
value:

**In [4]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfirstfun(arg1, arg2 = 2, *moreargs):
    '''Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
    It can be as long as you'd like.
    This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them
    any extra arguments are printed to the screen
    '''
    for i in arg1, arg2:
        assert type(i) == int or type(i) == float
    print("here are the extra arguments {x}".format(x = list(moreargs)))
    return(arg1 + arg2)

myfirstfun(1,2,3,4,5,6)
{% endhighlight %}

    here are the extra arguments [3, 4, 5, 6]





    3



**In [5]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun(10)
{% endhighlight %}

    here are the extra arguments []





    12



### Named Arguments

Python supports named arguments, unlike most languages, but similar to R:

**In [9]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(a, b):
    return(a ** 3 + b)
myfunction(b = 3, a = 2)
#by position, expect 29
{% endhighlight %}




    11



We go by name, then order

**In [26]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(a, b = "hi", c = "bye", d = "hey"):
    for i in a,b,c,d:
        print(i)
myfunction("hello", c = "no")
print("\n")
myfunction("hello", "no")
{% endhighlight %}

    hello
    hi
    no
    hey


    hello
    no
    bye
    hey


We can combine named and unnamed values. Any positional arguments are passed as
a tuple, any named arguments are passed as a dictionary. We add a \* to
positional, and \*\* to keyword arguments.

Named arguments must go last:

**In [35]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(*positional, **keywords):
    print("Positional:", positional)
    print("Keywords:", keywords)

myfunction('one', 'two', 'three')
myfunction('one', a = 'two', b = 'three')
{% endhighlight %}

    Positional: ('one', 'two', 'three')
    Keywords: {}
    None
    Positional: ('one',)
    Keywords: {'a': 'two', 'b': 'three'}


**In [36]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfunction(a = 'one', b = 'two', 'three')
{% endhighlight %}


      File "<ipython-input-36-80cc4c5ccb1f>", line 1
        myfunction(a = 'one', b = 'two', 'three')
                                        ^
    SyntaxError: positional argument follows keyword argument



### Warning

For default values, we evaluate them at function definition - this saves time
but can lead to error when using mutable defaults

**In [19]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(a = 1, b = 2^45):
    return(a + b)
print(myfunction())
print(myfunction(2,4))
print(b)
{% endhighlight %}

    48
    6



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-19-ec15857dd71f> in <module>()
          3 print(myfunction())
          4 print(myfunction(2,4))
    ----> 5 print(b)


    NameError: name 'b' is not defined


**In [24]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(a = 1, b = []):
    b.append(a)
    return(b)

print(myfunction(2))
print(myfunction(42))
#extremely weird behaviour for anyone coming from R!
{% endhighlight %}

    [2]
    [2, 42]


**In [37]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfunction(a = 1, b = None):
    if b is None:
        b = []
    b.append(a)
    return(b)
print(myfunction(2))
print(myfunction(42))
{% endhighlight %}

    [2]
    [42]


### Closures

We can do almost anything we'd like inside a function, including defining other
functions:

**In [39]:**

{% highlight python %}
def internaldef(a,b):
    def helper(c):
        return(c ** 5)
    return(helper(a) + helper(b))
internaldef(2,2)
{% endhighlight %}




    64



Internal functions have access to the enclosing variables:

**In [41]:**

{% highlight python %}
def internaldef(a,b):
    def helper(c):
        return(c ** b)
    return(helper(a) + helper(b))
internaldef(2,2)
{% endhighlight %}




    8



And we can even return them (a function generating function is technically a
'closure'):

**In [81]:**

{% highlight python %}
def makepow(a):
    def pown(num):
        return(num ** a)
    return(pown)
pow4 = makepow(4)
pow4(3)
{% endhighlight %}




    81



### Lambda Functions and map

Lambda functions are functions which are defined and used in the same place -
they are 'anonymous' (see Rs version `lapply(x, function(z) z^2`)). They are
generally used inside another statement, where defining a function is not worth
the time.

We can also use the lamdba to define a function:

**In [78]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfun = lambda x,y: x+y
myfun(1,2)
{% endhighlight %}




    3



**In [80]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]
[myfun(x,y) for x,y in l]
{% endhighlight %}




    [3, 7, 11]



`map` takes two arguments - a function (often a lambda function) and a sequence
(or sequences) to iterate over

**In [75]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
x = map(lambda x: x if x % 2 == 1 else x **2, l)
list(x)
{% endhighlight %}




    [1, 4, 3, 16, 5, 36]



**In [94]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = range(6)
k = range(6,12)
x = map(lambda x,y : x*y, l,k)
list(x)
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 7, 16, 27, 40, 55]



**In [98]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = map(lambda x, y: x if x%2 == 1 else y, l,k)
list(x)
{% endhighlight %}




    [6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5]



That's it for today. Next week we will move onto advanced functions - scope,
recursion, decorators and hashing, as well as classes - how to define our own
data types and methods

## Motivation

How much can we actually learn and predict from Data Science using Python?

Recently, a match fixing ring in professional tennis was alleged by a joint
investigation between [BBC news](http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35319202) and
[Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket#.eplO3d4px),
resulting in a large amount of news coverage.

The data analysis carried out was done in Python, and released online as an
[iPython Notebook](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-
analysis/blob/master/notebooks/tennis-analysis.ipynb). This story, and its
continued fall out, was [front page news on the
Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/09/revealed-tennis-umpires-
secretly-banned-gambling-scam) yesterday (9-Feb-2016).

Have a read through the notebook, take note of the functions and methods used on
the data, and see if you believe the analysis.
