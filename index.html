<h3 id="course-outline">Course Outline</h3>

<p>Python is a free, open source, extremely powerful and versatile programming language. It is widely used
in web, application and mobile development, and is becoming one of the powerhouses of data science.</p>

<p>This 10-lesson course will give learners a background in basic Python syntax, methods and functions, and
then introduce them to the current bleeding edge of data science tools.</p>

<p>The data science stack in Python consists of a number of modules, each of which will be introduced and
explored in the course. We will cover a range of data import and export methods, NumPy and Pandas
for data munging and vectorization, IPython and Jupyter for reproducible and powerful notebooks,
matplotlib for graphing and visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning.</p>

<p>The course will be taught using Python 3.4 and the Anaconda Python distribution. The course will be
taught using a combination of live coding and learner exercises, with notes and exercises being provided
as Jupyter notebooks and on this website.</p>

<h3 id="streams">Streams</h3>

<p>Both streams will start with an intro to the basics of Python (the applied section will stay with this longer) and then they will diverge on subject matter. The material for both sections will be present here for all to browse, so you can keep an eye on what is going on in the other section. The R&amp;D section will provide exposure to a variety of material, but it’s up to you to decide whether it’s relevant for your role. The R&amp;D section will also require a larger overall commitment (and individual progress is being tracked).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/pythoncourse/tag/Applied%20Statistics%20stream/">Applied Statistics stream</a>. Here, the focus will be on the daily nuts and bolts of doing applied data science with Python. The focus will be on modeling, testing, debugging, data wrangling, visualization, reporting, etc. This is where most of the Data &amp; Tech and the Stats team will be, so that they can work Python into the programming work they do in their daily roles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/pythoncourse/tag/R&amp;D%20stream/">R&amp;D stream</a>. This assumes significant programming experience (or the ability to catch up fast), requires quite a bit of follow-up research outside of class, and focuses on more abstract issues such as high-level machine learning, optimization, parallelization and so on. This is a section largely for the R&amp;D team + a few others who work on such issues in their daily roles.</p>
