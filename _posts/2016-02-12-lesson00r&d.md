## Welcome to the Python course @ Precima

Hopefully everyone has read the syllabus, cheat sheets and course outline on the
website.

They are available at www.jeremy.kiwi.nz/pythoncourse.

All lessons are made as iPython notebooks and will be available on this site to
download. Grab todays lesson from [this
link!](/pythoncourse/assets/notebooks/r&d/lesson 00.ipynb).

Today we will briefly go over course logistics and the Anaconda environment and
then dive into Python data types.

### Python

Python is a programming language first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and
one of the most popular languages used in computing today. Python currently
ranks as the [5th most common language used on
github](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github).

Python is used as a scripting language, as well as in web development and to
create applications - some of the more popular websites and applications running
at least partially on Python include: Google, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram,
Reddit, Dropbox, Civilization IV, EVE Online and BitTorrent.

Python as a language is based on readability, flexibility, simplicity and
extensibility.

The extensibility of Python has caused it to be adopted, along with R, as one of
the premier data science programming languages.

Python has had many added on modules (or libraries) added to it, to allow data
science work which we will cover in this course.

In general compared to R, Python is faster, more programmer focussed and less
restrictive in licensing. The downside is new statistical methods tend to appear
in R before Python, although as the community grows, this has become less of a
problem.

### Anaconda, iPython and Spyder

We will use Anaconda, a distribution of Python by Continuum Analytics, put
together for use in data science.

Anaconda comes with most of the modules we need for data analysis, as well as
Jupyter notebooks, and the IDE we will use for the first couple of lessons,
Spyder.

We have installed the launcher, which allows updating and launching these apps,
the Spyder IDE which allows coding and running scripts in an integrated
environment, the iPython-QT console, which is an advanced console allowing
inline graphing, and the iPython notebook, which allows development in
interactive notebooks in the browser. These programs all run Python code - the
difference is in how you interact with the environment.

iPython notebooks are currently in the process of being rebranded into Jupyter
notebooks - the launcher and documentation will refer to them interchangeably.

Coding along with the lesson is encouraged!



### 2.7 vs 3

In 2008, Python version 3.0 was released. Due to the number and nature of
changes, Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 were not compatible. This has lead to a split
in the Python community, as many users were unwilling to fix existing code to 3
compatibility, and have since continued to develop Python 2.6 into 2.7, while
3.0 has been developed in parallel and currently stands at version 3.5.

In this course, we will use Python 3. This is due to the majority of users
having no legacy code to worry about, the better memory management, and the
availability of the data science stack in Python 3. If you are a die hard Python
2.7 user, feel free to continue using it, although you will need to fix the code
yourself.

In the level we will be coding at the changes are not too big, the largest
differences we will see are `print()` vs `print`, `xrange` vs `range` and other
generators. Python code found online will often be 2.7, but should be readable
by a 3 trained user.


### Course Logistics

This stream of the course will cover applied data science in Python. We will
start by covering the basic data types and structures, move on to loops and
statements, then functions and classes. In lessons 4 and 5 we will introduce the
standard data  modules, Pandas and NumPy, then move on into graphing,
reproducible research and machine learning in the later stages of the course.
Please let me know if you have any particular applications or problems, and we
will try and address the common ones in class.

We are tracking progress, to make sure this course is giving value for your time
- Please make sure you answer the quizzes and assessments we will send out later
in the course.

### Outside Resources

A number of people have asked about text books or online resources for the
course. Most Python tutorials online will assume a knowledge at around the level
we will reach at the end of lesson 3. I'm using [Python for Data
Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) for the numpy and
pandas section - It won't be necessary to purchase but is a good book if a
little outdated. For the other lessons, links will be provided to the relevant
docs.



## Basic Data Types

### Numbers

Python has ints, floats and complex numbers - we can check using the `type`
function

**In [1]:**

{% highlight python %}
type(3)
{% endhighlight %}




    int



**In [2]:**

{% highlight python %}
type(3.0)
{% endhighlight %}




    float



**In [4]:**

{% highlight python %}
type(1 + 0.3J)
{% endhighlight %}




    complex



Internally, floats are stored as double in `C` - use sys.float_info for more
information about tolerances etc.

Complex is stored as two floats - the real and imaginary parts.

Integers have unlimited precision

**In [5]:**

{% highlight python %}
import sys
sys.float_info
{% endhighlight %}




    sys.float_info(max=1.7976931348623157e+308, max_exp=1024, max_10_exp=308, min=2.2250738585072014e-308, min_exp=-1021, min_10_exp=-307, dig=15, mant_dig=53, epsilon=2.220446049250313e-16, radix=2, rounds=1)



**In [6]:**

{% highlight python %}
z = 10**1000000 +1
z % 10
{% endhighlight %}




    1



Python 2.7 has another class, `large` for large numbers, Python 3 makes the
conversion implicilty and keeps type `int`:

**In [7]:**

{% highlight python %}
print(type(z))
del(z)
{% endhighlight %}

    <class 'int'>


We can assign values to variables:

**In [8]:**

{% highlight python %}
a = 23
b = 2 ** 4
c, d = 2 - 4, 3 / 2
{% endhighlight %}

There are some rules about variable names - they cannot start with numbers, must
be alphanumeric with no spaces, and should be lowercase with underscores and
somewhat informative about what they represent:

Check out the [official Python style guide](http://docs.python-
guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/), or [Googles Python style
guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for more tips regarding
variable names and general coding style.

In iPython based interpreters, we can use `whos` to see all our declared
variables (or use the spyder IDE)

**In [9]:**

{% highlight python %}
whos
{% endhighlight %}

    Variable   Type      Data/Info
    ------------------------------
    a          int       23
    b          int       16
    c          int       -2
    d          float     1.5
    sys        module    <module 'sys' (built-in)>


### Warning - Floating Point Errors

We would expect the below to be equal to -0.2 - what is going on?

**In [10]:**

{% highlight python %}
-0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3
{% endhighlight %}




    -0.19999999999999998



This is a floating point error. It occurs as computers work in binary and 1/10
is a repeating fraction in binary, much like 1/3 is in base 10. We will discuss
mitigation techniques later in the course - for now be aware when working with
floats.

### Booleans

We have the standard boolean operators

Which can then be chained using `and` `or` with not as a negation

**In [11]:**

{% highlight python %}
1 == 1 and 2 >= 3
{% endhighlight %}




    False



**In [12]:**

{% highlight python %}
1 <= 1 or 2 > 3
{% endhighlight %}




    True



**In [13]:**

{% highlight python %}
not True
{% endhighlight %}




    False



In addition to True and False, we also have None, which we will discuss later in
the course

In Python, booleans are short circuit operators - once one conditon is
impossible we stop evaluating. this can get a good speed up on code if you have
one expensive comparison and one that is not - put the cheap calculation first

**In [14]:**

{% highlight python %}
#del(l)
x = 5
#l is not defined! This would give and error if it hits l
print(x == 5 or l == 4)
print(x == 3 and l == 4)
{% endhighlight %}

    True
    False


### Warning - Bitwise Operations

You probably don't want to use `|`, `&` or `^` which many other languages do for
`or` `and` and `not`- they are for [bitwise
comparison](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators).

**In [15]:**

{% highlight python %}
12 | 9
{% endhighlight %}




    13



**In [16]:**

{% highlight python %}
print(bin(12))
print(bin(9))
print(bin(13))
{% endhighlight %}

    0b1100
    0b1001
    0b1101


### Strings

Strings are character type data:

**In [17]:**

{% highlight python %}
a = "abcde"
g = 'use the \\ to escape \'special\' characters or \n make new lines and \t tabs'
print(g)
{% endhighlight %}

    use the \ to escape 'special' characters or
     make new lines and 	 tabs


**In [18]:**

{% highlight python %}
g ='''
this is
a long
string'''
print(g)
{% endhighlight %}


    this is
    a long
    string


We can do (some) math on strings

**In [19]:**

{% highlight python %}
print(a * 2)
print(a + d)
print(a * a)
{% endhighlight %}

    abcdeabcde



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-19-badeb938c1f1> in <module>()
          1 print(a * 2)
    ----> 2 print(a + d)
          3 print(a * a)


    TypeError: Can't convert 'float' object to str implicitly


## Subsetting

When we want to get a subset of a string (or many other Python objects) we use
subsetting.

Python is a 0-indexed language, meaning we start counting at 0. For a
digression, see here for a [possible origin of 0
indexing](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/).

This leads to the famous quote "The two big problems in computer science are
cache invalidation, naming things and off by one errors".

**In [20]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_string = 'Hello world'
#a single element
print(my_string[0])
#a slice
print(my_string[0:3])
#from the start
print(my_string[:3])
#to the end
print(my_string[3:])
#negative indices count from the end
print(my_string[-3:])
{% endhighlight %}

    H
    Hel
    Hel
    lo world
    rld


Indexing can also use a third place ie `x[from:to:by]`, but this is not used
often in practice.

**In [21]:**

{% highlight python %}
print(my_string[::2])
print(my_string[::-1])
print(my_string[0:6:2])
{% endhighlight %}

    Hlowrd
    dlrow olleH
    Hlo


Strings are immutable - we cannot easily change elements of them in place:

**In [22]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_string[0] = 'h'
{% endhighlight %}


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-22-8e10d58363b9> in <module>()
    ----> 1 my_string[0] = 'h'


    TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment


### Methods

Methods are functions which are specific to a certain type of object. They are
called using x.method()

We can see a list in Spyder by using tab or use help(object) to get a list

**In [23]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_string = 'abcde'
print(my_string.upper())
print(my_string.upper().lower())
print(my_string.capitalize())
#help(my_string)
{% endhighlight %}

    ABCDE
    abcde
    Abcde


### Functions

We have a number of built in functions in Python, similar to methods but not
linked to a specific class. See the list at the [official Python docs
website](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html)

For help, use help(function) or read the online docs.


### Print Formatting

We can format our print output using our defined variables:

**In [24]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = 13.13
print('blah blah %s' %(x))
print('Floating point numbers: %1.2f' %(13.144))
print('First: %s, Second: %1.2f, Third: %r' %('hi!', 3.14, 22))
print('First: {y}, Second: {x}, Third: {z}'.format(y = "hi", z = 12.1, x = 12))
{% endhighlight %}

    blah blah 13.13
    Floating point numbers: 13.14
    First: hi!, Second: 3.14, Third: 22
    First: hi, Second: 12, Third: 12.1


## Basic Data Containers


### Lists

Lists are the workhorse of Python - they are a way of containing multiple pieces
of data in a single place.

Lists may be recognised as similar to arrays in other languages - we don't need
to preassign type, size or any other attributes


**In [25]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
#subsetting similar to strings
print(my_list[0:2])
#add similarly to strings
print(my_list * 2)
print(my_list + [1, 2, 3])
print(my_list + [[1, 2, 3, 4]])
{% endhighlight %}

    [1, 2]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, [1, 2, 3, 4]]


Lists can contain multiple data types, including other lists:

**In [26]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list = [True, "hi", 1, 3.4, [1, 2, 3]]
print(type(my_list))
#nested subset
print([my_list[1][1], my_list[-1][-1]])
{% endhighlight %}

    <class 'list'>
    ['i', 3]


Lists are mutable

**In [27]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list[1] = "bye"
print(my_list)
{% endhighlight %}

    [True, 'bye', 1, 3.4, [1, 2, 3]]


### List Methods

Lists have their own methods. Many of these will modify a list in place, so
beware

**In [28]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list = [True, "hi", 1, 3.4, [1, 2, 3]]
my_list.append('a new list item')
my_list
{% endhighlight %}




    [True, 'hi', 1, 3.4, [1, 2, 3], 'a new list item']



**In [29]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list.extend([1,2,3])
my_list
{% endhighlight %}




    [True, 'hi', 1, 3.4, [1, 2, 3], 'a new list item', 1, 2, 3]



**In [30]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list = [3,4,1,2]
my_list.sort()
print(my_list)
my_list.sort(reverse=True)
print(my_list)
{% endhighlight %}

    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    [4, 3, 2, 1]


### Warning

Python lists are not copied on reassignment. This will cause problems!

**In [31]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list2 = my_list
my_list2[0] = 5
my_list
{% endhighlight %}




    [5, 2, 3, 4]



We can fix it using slicing, copying or the list() function:

**In [32]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list2 = my_list[:]
my_list2[1] = 5
my_list
{% endhighlight %}




    [1, 2, 3, 4]



**In [33]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list2 = list(my_list)
my_list2[1] = 5
my_list
{% endhighlight %}




    [1, 2, 3, 4]



**In [34]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_list2 = my_list.copy()
my_list2[1] = 5
my_list
{% endhighlight %}




    [1, 2, 3, 4]



### Tuples

Tuples are more or less immutable lists, and as such have less methods
associated with them

**In [35]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_tup = (1,2,3,4,5,1)
print(my_tup.index(5))
print(my_tup[2])
print(my_tup.count(1))
print(list(my_tup))
my_tup[0] = 1
{% endhighlight %}

    4
    3
    2
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-35-e9f3c06e3e04> in <module>()
          4 print(my_tup.count(1))
          5 print(list(my_tup))
    ----> 6 my_tup[0] = 1


    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment


**In [36]:**

{% highlight python %}
#multiple assignment technically uses tuples
a,b,c,d = 1,2,3,4
{% endhighlight %}

Tuples are a great choice when using parameters in a script - we cannot
overwrite them by mistake without reassigning the entire tuple

### Sets

Sets work like the mathematical notion of sets - only unique elements are
allowed, and they are unordered

**In [37]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_set = {1,2,3,4,5,1,2}
print(my_set)
print(type(my_set))
{% endhighlight %}

    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    <class 'set'>


**In [38]:**

{% highlight python %}
# no subsetting by index!
# hence no mutability either
my_set[0]
{% endhighlight %}


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-38-820e4eb6e783> in <module>()
          1 # no subsetting by index!
          2 # hence no mutability either
    ----> 3 my_set[0]


    TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing


### Dictionaries

Python dictionaries are a very useful data structure, which we will modify into
DataFrames inside pandas.

For now they are very similar to hashes or lookup tables from other languages -
we access data inside them by key, rather than index. As such, they are
unordered, similar to sets.


**In [39]:**

{% highlight python %}
#key:values pairs, keys must be unique
my_dict = {'key1' : "val1", 'key2':'val2', 1:[1,2,3,4], 2:"a"}
print(my_dict)
{% endhighlight %}

    {1: [1, 2, 3, 4], 'key2': 'val2', 2: 'a', 'key1': 'val1'}


**In [40]:**

{% highlight python %}
print(my_dict[1])
print(my_dict['key2'])
print(my_dict[0])
{% endhighlight %}

    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    val2



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-40-cb18261125fd> in <module>()
          1 print(my_dict[1])
          2 print(my_dict['key2'])
    ----> 3 print(my_dict[0])


    KeyError: 0


**In [41]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_dict['newkey'] = 'newval'
my_dict.update({"newkey2":'newval2'})
print(my_dict)
{% endhighlight %}

    {1: [1, 2, 3, 4], 'key2': 'val2', 'newkey2': 'newval2', 'newkey': 'newval', 2: 'a', 'key1': 'val1'}


**In [42]:**

{% highlight python %}
print(my_dict.keys())
print(my_dict.items())
print(my_dict.values())
{% endhighlight %}

    dict_keys([1, 'key2', 'newkey2', 'newkey', 2, 'key1'])
    dict_items([(1, [1, 2, 3, 4]), ('key2', 'val2'), ('newkey2', 'newval2'), ('newkey', 'newval'), (2, 'a'), ('key1', 'val1')])
    dict_values([[1, 2, 3, 4], 'val2', 'newval2', 'newval', 'a', 'val1'])


**In [43]:**

{% highlight python %}
my_dict['key1']
{% endhighlight %}




    'val1'



## Python Statements

Python uses indentation, rather than braces, as its primary way of parsing loops
and statements. This was originally to force some degree of readability on code.

### If, Else, Elif

We can do if and else statements

**In [44]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = 5

if not True:
    print(x)
elif x == 5:
    print(x+1)
else:
    print("no")


#if True:
#print(x)
{% endhighlight %}

    6


and nest them as deep as we would like:

**In [45]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = [10]

if x[0] >= 10 and len(x) == 1:
    if x[0] % 2 == 0:
        if abs(x[0]) > 50:
            print(x)
        else:
            print(x[0] + 1)
            if x[0] // 3 == 3:
                x.append(1)
    elif x[0] * 3 > 25:
        x.append("hi")
    else:
        x.append("bye")
else:
    print(x[0]+5)
x
{% endhighlight %}

    11





    [10, 1]



### For loops

For loops work similarly in syntax to if and else. We can use them on any of the
major data structures we just introduced

**In [46]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

for num in l:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("even")
    else:
        print("odd")

print("\n")
s = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}

for num in s:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("even")
    else:
        print("odd")
{% endhighlight %}

    odd
    even
    odd
    even
    odd
    even
    odd
    even


    odd
    even
    odd
    even
    odd
    even
    odd
    even


On dictionaries, we have to do it a little differently

**In [47]:**

{% highlight python %}
d = {'k1':'v1', 'k2':'v2', 'k3':'v3'}

for k, v in d.items():
    print(k + v)

#similar for nested lists:

l = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]

for one, two in l:
    print(one * two)
    #no modifying!
    one = one * 2
l
{% endhighlight %}

    k3v3
    k2v2
    k1v1
    2
    12
    30
    56





    [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]



### While loops

Similarly, we can use while loops, and run a loop until a condition is met

**In [48]:**

{% highlight python %}
x = 5

while x > 1:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
{% endhighlight %}

    5
    4
    3
    2


### Break, Pass, Continue

We can skip, break or pass elements in our loops

**In [49]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,"hi",6]

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print("it's not a number")
        break

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print("it's not a number")
        continue
        print("how did you get here?")

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        print(num)
    else:
        print("it's not a number")
        pass
        print("how did you get here?")

continue and break only go up to the nearest closest loop - if we are nested we
don't go right to the end of the statement:

**In [50]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,"hi",6]

for num in l:
    if type(num) == int:
        if num % 2 == 1:
            continue
            print(num)
        else:
            print(num)
    else:
        continue
{% endhighlight %}

    2
    4
    6


### Range

we saw earlier, we cannot modify in place using a loop. We can instead use
`range` to generate indices and use these (NB range in Python 3 is similar to
xrange in Python 2.7, not `range`). Range objects are not instantly ennnumerated
- we dont have to hold them in memory.

**In [51]:**

{% highlight python %}
#similar to the subset from:to:by
range(0,10,2)
type(range(0,10))
{% endhighlight %}




    range



**In [52]:**

{% highlight python %}
l = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
range(len(l))
{% endhighlight %}




    range(0, 6)



**In [53]:**

{% highlight python %}
for i in range(len(l)):
    l[i] = l[i]*2
l
{% endhighlight %}




    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]



**In [54]:**

{% highlight python %}
#also useful for generating simple lists:
list(range(10))
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]



### Comprehensions

Comprehensions are are syntactic sugar for for loops. We can make lists (or set
or dicts) using this method. Tuples might seem like they should also have a
method, but this is reserved for generators, which will discuss later on in the
course.


**In [55]:**

{% highlight python %}
#for loop
l = []
for i in range(10):
    l.append(i * 5)
l
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]



**In [56]:**

{% highlight python %}
#comprehension
[i * 5 for i in range(10)]
{% endhighlight %}




    [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]



**In [57]:**

{% highlight python %}
#dict comprehension
{i * 10 : j * 2  for i, j in {1: 'a', 2: 'b'}.items()}
{% endhighlight %}




    {10: 'aa', 20: 'bb'}



**In [58]:**

{% highlight python %}
celsius = [0,100,25,37]
[((9/5)*temp + 32) for temp in celsius]
{% endhighlight %}




    [32.0, 212.0, 77.0, 98.60000000000001]



**In [59]:**

{% highlight python %}
#nested
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[el * 2 for el in row] for row in matrix]
{% endhighlight %}




    [[2, 4, 6], [8, 10, 12], [14, 16, 18]]



### Ternary expressions

Ternary expressions are a fancy way of doing `if` `else` and is very pythonic:

**In [60]:**

{% highlight python %}
a = 12
a if a > 11 else b
{% endhighlight %}




    12



**In [61]:**

{% highlight python %}
a = 10
b = "no"
a if a > 11 else b
{% endhighlight %}




    'no'



we can chain this with our comprehensions

**In [62]:**

{% highlight python %}
[a if a else 2 for a in [0,1,0,3]]
{% endhighlight %}




    [2, 1, 2, 3]



or our nested comprehensions

**In [63]:**

{% highlight python %}
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[el * 2 if el % 2 == 0 else el for el in row] for row in matrix]
{% endhighlight %}




    [[1, 4, 3], [8, 5, 12], [7, 16, 9]]



As these comprehensions are not faster than a for loop, it is worth using for
loops once you can't follow clearly what the comprehension is doing (I would
almost never use a nested comprehension)!

## Intro to Functions

Functions are one of the key parts of any programming language. Today we will
touch on basic syntax and definition, and move into a more thorough exploration
in the next class.

**In [64]:**

{% highlight python %}
def celcius_to_fahr(temp):
    return (9/5)*temp + 32

celcius_to_fahr(100)
{% endhighlight %}




    212.0



**In [65]:**

{% highlight python %}
def kelvin_to_celcius(temp):
    return temp - 273

kelvin_to_celcius(100)
{% endhighlight %}




    -173



**In [66]:**

{% highlight python %}
def kelvin_to_fahr(temp):
    return celcius_to_fahr(kelvin_to_celcius(temp))

kelvin_to_fahr(273)
{% endhighlight %}




    32.0



**In [67]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfirstfun(arg1, arg2):
    '''Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
    It can be as long as you'd like.
    This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them
    '''
    return(arg1 + arg2)

help(myfirstfun)
{% endhighlight %}

    Help on function myfirstfun in module __main__:

    myfirstfun(arg1, arg2)
        Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
        It can be as long as you'd like.
        This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them



**In [68]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun(1, 2)
{% endhighlight %}




    3



**In [69]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun("h", "i")
{% endhighlight %}




    'hi'



We might not want our function to work on strings! We can Raise an error is the
arguments are not numeric:

**In [70]:**

{% highlight python %}
def myfirstfun(arg1, arg2):
    '''Here is the docstring. this will be displayed to a user calling help(myfirstfun)
    It can be as long as you'd like.
    This argument takes two arguments, and returns the sum of them
    '''
    for i in arg1, arg2:
        assert type(i) == int or type(i) == float
    return(arg1 + arg2)

myfirstfun(1,2)
{% endhighlight %}




    3



**In [71]:**

{% highlight python %}
myfirstfun("h", "i")
{% endhighlight %}

That's it for today. Next week we will move onto advanced functions - scope,
recursion, decorators and hashing, as well as classes - how to define our own
data types and methods

## Motivation

How much can we actually learn and predict from Data Science using Python?

Recently, a match fixing ring in professional tennis was alleged by a joint
investigation between [BBC news](http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35319202) and
[Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket#.eplO3d4px),
resulting in a large amount of news coverage.

The data analysis carried out was done in Python, and released online as an
[iPython Notebook](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2016-01-tennis-betting-
analysis/blob/master/notebooks/tennis-analysis.ipynb). This story, and its
continued fall out, was [front page news on the
Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/09/revealed-tennis-umpires-
secretly-banned-gambling-scam) yesterday (9-Feb-2016).

Have a read through the notebook, take note of the functions and methods used on
the data, and see if you believe the analysis.
